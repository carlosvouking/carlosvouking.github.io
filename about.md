Hands deep .Net development and voice driven applications (Alexa, Google Home, Samsung Bixby)

   My education in Japan in Business Administration and Information Technology lead me to Europe some years ago.  My daily work is made up of tasks' automation using the DotNet framework and Sql Server Reporting Services SSRS. 
   At the other corner of my head, I ask myself everyday how to build tools to make corporate life easier and frictionless by leveraging the power of voice first driven assistants. I have taken this path seriously and started translating it in developing few voice prototypes to get myself in the field. It is going to be a long, challenging journey, but enjoyable.
