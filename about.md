hands deep into Data Science and Predictive Analysis

My education in Japan in Business Administration and Information Technology lead me to Belgium few years ago.  My daily work is made up of tasks' automation and Sql Server Reporting SSRS. The potential and amount of data that I face on my daily work routine nurtured my interest for Artificial intelligence; I shall shortly  say Deep learning. 
      Learn new things, build stuffs, get better at doing, learn again to build better tools with so much opportunities around AI and Deep Learning. I have already joined the race.
Heartful thanks to [deeplearning.ai](www.deeplearning.ai) and specially to [fastai](www.fast.ai)
