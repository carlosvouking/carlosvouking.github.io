Hands deep into Data Science and Predictive Analysis

 My education in Japan in Business Administration and Information Technology lead me to Belgium few years ago.  My daily work is made up of tasks' automation and Sql Server Reporting Services SSRS. The potential and amount of data that I face daily at work nurtured my interest for Artificial intelligence; Shall I say Deep learning. 
 Learning new things, building stuffs, get better at doing, learn again to build better tools with the tremendous opportunities around AI and Deep Learning. I have joined the race.
Heartful thanks to [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai) and specially to [fast.ai](http://fast.ai)
