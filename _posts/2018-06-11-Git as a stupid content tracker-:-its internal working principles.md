[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) says that **'Git is a distributed revision control system'**. It tracks files and directories accross computer systems(_distribution_). Tracking and interacting with those files and directories require the use of specific commands in a bash terminal.

Git appears to be like a mapping table which links **keys** and **values** and save the (key, values) pairs in a system. To make it simple, let's say I am writing my thesis and as it goes, I would like to gradually edit it and save every edited copy of it. Each edited copy is mapped to a specific unique key and stored in a table. Git is just that table. Technically, the text in my thesis report is called a **body** and represents a sequence of bites. Giving a body to the mapping table (that is git),  generates a unique key also called a **hash**. The hash is computed using a type of algorithm called **SHA** (Secure hashing algorithm). The most widely used one is **SHA1** Each time I add modification to my thesis report and submit it to Git, it takes it, creates a new hash, couples it to the body and persist the **(hash, body)** pair in the system. there is only and exactly one hash for each body string. Hash keys generated by **SHA1** are 40 digits long.

The benefit of this is that, at a certain point in time, I can ask git to give me a specific saved version of my thesis report and it will be able to give me the exact one based on its  corresponding hash. That is conceptually how git works internally.

**Let's loo at it that practically.**
If I consider passing the string **_"deep learning"_** to git,to hash an object in git, use the command: **_git hash-object_** and append the body string to hash like so:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I end up with an error because 'hash-object' command takes 'deep learning' as the name of a file, which is not. I use a different approach by firing up your git bash commnad terminal and typing the following which will create a unique hash key.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git1.PNG)



What I do is outputting the _'deep learning'_ object with the _'echo_' command and passing it to the _'hash-object'_ from the standaed input (--stdin). Changing a letter or even the lower case **'d'** into uppercase **'D**', the The string **_"Deep learning"_** passed to git produces a complete different hash key:



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git2.PNG)



and again another string variation of **_"Deep Learning"_** gets me a yet different hash key.

this confirms the idea according to which editing my thesis report and passing it to git produces a unique and different key linked to each edited version of the report.



**Uniqueness scope of SHA1 keys**
the key computed by git for the string 'deep learning' is unique. it will always be 'b075a46024e2ea2b418a26ea14d4a57759fbf3d1' whether I am working with git in a specific project or even universally. For any bunch of strings I push to git, it will allocate a unique for that particular and exact bunch of strings. A different bunch of strings push will have a different hash key. Key collision is not possible.


**Git is also persistent**
When generating a hash key for the 'deep learning' string, the string itself can simultaneously be saved in the repository by appending an **'-w'** argument to  the hashing object command. **'-w'** which stands for 'write'. to save the string in a git repository, the repository itself has to exist. I can create one as follow: **'git init'**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git4.PNG)


check in the directory using 'ls -a' command , there is effectively a git repository initiated. the 'ls' command list the directory contents and the **'-a'** attribute shows the hidden files.  



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git5.PNG)



As far as I have a repository created, I can persist the 'deep learning' string into it while asking git to compute its hash key. The command **echo 'deep learning'** \'| **git hash-object --stdin -w** does it as follow:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git6.PNG)



Git has created the hash key and at the same time saved the its contents. Where is that hash key content saved? Query the content of the .git repository with **'ls .git'** shows what is present as default in the repository created above.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git7.PNG)



There is a few folders and files in the repository. Git usually saves all its contents in the **objects** folder know as **object database**.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git7_a.PNG)



if I look into the **objects** folder, there is a certain number of folders. The one that I will focus on now is the one named **b0/**. It happens that these first 2 digits ***'b'*** and ***'0'*** are the starting digits of the hash key generated when saving the string **'deep learning'**. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git8.PNG)




Inside the folder **b0/**, there is a file whose name corresponds to the remainig characters coming after the **'b0'** starting digits of the hash key. Git usually spreads its objects contents in a folder-like structure.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git9.PNG)




One question which might be raised is where the string **'deep learning'** stored ? It has been encrypted within the file and because of the compression that git makes to save space, this file within the **'b0'** folder can't just be opened. However to look at its content, git provides the following command:
**'git cat-file '**,  which takes the name of the file as the argument with the **-t** attribute appended to it to tell more about the type of the file.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![png](/images/git10.PNG)




the whole folder structure 'b0'/'75a46024e2ea2b418a26ea14d4a57759fbf3d1' is called a **blob**; just to mean a piece of content. To actually unzip the file, remove the header and retrieve the string hidden by thr hash key, I run the same command but this time with the **-p** argument which tells git to print the actual content of the file. The original string 'deep learning' is retrieved.
