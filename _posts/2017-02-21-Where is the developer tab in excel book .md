Hey, I felt the need to bring this quick one out. I spent 10 minutes figuring out where the developer tab is  located on the excel book. I got a little bit frustrated and had to google it. 

I just decided to write it down as mark of my effort to find this out. Then will I forget it again ? NO

### Where is the developer tab located ?
The developer tab by default, does not appear on the tab area of excel books as shown below:

We need to explicetely add it. If you go to the menu bar and hit **'File ---> Options'**, you will be  presented with the following:

Then hit **'Customize Ribbon'** on the left vertical pane to show the following view:

Now make sure the **'Customize Ribbon'** on the top right has the value '**Main Tabs**' attached to its combo box.

It remains to check the developer option and hit OK. And voil√†! we have the **'Developer'** tab in the menu.
