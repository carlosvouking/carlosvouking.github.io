Hey, I felt the need to bring this quick one out. I spent 10 minutes figuring out where the developer tab is  located on the excel book. I got a little bit frustrated and had to google it. 

I just decided to write it down as mark of my effort to find this out. Then will I forget it again ? NO

### Where is the developer tab located ?
the developer tab by default does not appear on the tab area of excel books.
