I started using [resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkdHCxbix3wIVB-d3Ch2gSg6sEAAYASAAEgJ2gfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) a while ago alongside my projects in visual studio.
It is an incredible tool which is making my life a way much easier when writing code. 
I started with a trial version and definetly adopted it. From short cuts to refactoring, unit tests and navigation, resharper has everything I need to bring my development experience to the next speed.
