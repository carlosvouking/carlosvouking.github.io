 This is not a new concept at all, but it really blew my mind by the way it tremendously increased ML models accuracies. What **data augmentation** does is simply at the level of the images that we use to train deep learning models. It is kind of an abstract concept because, there is no really an increase of the number of original images, but a virtual flipping giving the impression that we are in the presence of more images. This actually makes the classifier.
