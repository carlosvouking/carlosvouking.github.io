This is not a new concept at all, but it really blew my mind how it tremendously increased ML models accuracies. The intuition behind this comes from the need to have more data to accurately train deep learning models.

What **data augmentation** does is simply at the level of the images that we use to train deep learning models. It is kind of an abstract concept because, there is not really an increase of the number of original images, but a virtual flipping giving the impression that we are in the presence of more images. Flipping original images can be done **vertically**, **horizontally** or in combining vertical and horizontal rotations.
