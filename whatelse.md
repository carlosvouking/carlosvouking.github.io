# **How to locally clone a repository from Github ?**
***
This simply to create a copy of the repository on the local system and allow bidirectional communication or sync between the local copy and the remote repository on github. It happens in few simple steps:

#### (1-) Connect to github and browse to the specific repository page and hit the 'clone or download' button:

#### (2-) In the 'clone with HTTPS' section, copy the url i the texbox as shown below:







![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cloning_2_.PNG)







#### (3-) shift to the local system and start the '**Git Bash**' prompt and point to the directory where to save the copy of the repository. Then type '**git clone**' and append to it the url copied from the 'clone with HTTPS' section in the previous step:



![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cloning_3_.PNG)




Excecute the whole command and a local clone of your directory is normally created in the directory chosed earlier.
